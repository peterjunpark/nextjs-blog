MVC is a design pattern used in software development to separate an application's logic and user interface into three interconnected components:

## Model

The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It encapsulates the data, the rules for manipulating that data, and the interactions with the underlying database or other data sources. In essence, the Model is responsible for managing the state of the application. It provides methods to create, retrieve, update, and delete data, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

## View

The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user in a human-readable format. It displays information to users and receives user input. The View doesn't perform any data processing; it simply renders the data provided by the Model. Views can encompass everything from graphical user interfaces to simple textual representations.

## Controller

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user input, processes requests, and decides how to respond. When a user interacts with the application, such as submitting a form or clicking a button, the Controller receives the input, determines the appropriate action to take, and updates the Model accordingly. It also updates the View to reflect any changes in the Model's state.
